== Red Hat SSO - An Introduction

Red Hat SSO is used in this module to both offer single-sign on to Mobile users, and also for securing the APIs. 

[TIP]
====
We will be using OpenID Connect which is an open authentication protocol that works on top of the OAuth 2.0 framework. OIDC offers a discovery mechanism called *OpenID Connect Discovery*, where an OpenID server (here Red Hat SSO based on Keycloak) publishes its metadata at a well-known URL. This URL is typically a collection of various endpoints the server offers, some of which are used in this workshop too.
====

* Launch Red Hat SSO by clicking {sso_tenant_console}[SSO Console^,window="sso"] and login using username and password (globex/openshift).
* Click on the *OpenID Endpoint Configuration* link to view the *OpenID Provider Configuration* of Red Hat SSO.
+
.Red Hat SSO - Logged In
image::apim-sso-login.png[]

[WARNING]
====
In case you see an error stating *You don't have access to the requested resource*, you will need to logout, close the browser tab, and login again

* Click on *Sign Out* and close the browser
* Launch Red Hat SSO by clicking {sso_tenant_console}[SSO Console^,window="sso"] and login using username and password (globex/openshift).
* Login as *(globex/openshift)*. 
====



* Here is how the *OpenID Provider Configuration* looks like
+
.Red Hat SSO - OpenID Provider Configuration
image::well-know-openid-configuration.png[]
* We are interested specifically in the following endpoints

[cols="50%,50%"]
|===
|Endpoint | URL

| *OpenID Provider Configuration (well-known config)*: +
This URL provides a mechanism to discover the End-User's OpenID Provider and obtain information needed to interact with it, including OpenID/OAuth endpoint locations. The following endpoints is fetched from this URL |
https://sso.{openshift_subdomain}/auth/realms/globex/.well-known/openid-configuration 

| *issuer*: +
This value is needed when we need to authorize a user through single sign-on |

https://sso.{openshift_subdomain}/auth/realms/globex

| *token_endpoint* : +
clients can obtain access tokens from the server using this token endpoint and use these same tokens to access protected resources (APIs in our case) |
https://sso.{openshift_subdomain}/auth/realms/globex/protocol/openid-connect/token

== Design and Govern Mobile OpenAPI Specification

//API design refers to the process of developing application programming interfaces (APIs) that expose data and application functionality for use by developers and users. Red Hat API Designer, based on https://www.apicur.io/[Apicurio^], is a lightweight tool that helps you to design APIs. 

In this step you will import the draft OpenAPI specs for *Mobile App* and edit them to include *Security Schemes*. Once the API design phase is complete you will then manage that within the Red Hat Service Registry. The API Designer sessions are stateless and you must save your API definition as a JSON file at the end of each session. 


=== Section Goals

* Import a draft OpenAPI specification for Mobile App into an API Designer
* Edit the draft OpenAPI specification to add *OpenID Security Schemes* and include Red Hat SSO's OpenID Provider Configuration
* Govern the Mobile OpenAPI with Red Hat Service Registry

=== Design Mobile OpenAPI
To import the OpenAPI draft into API designer, you can import as text OR upload as file. To keep things simple in this workshop, you will import the content by simply pasting the draft spec as YAML based text into the API designer.

[NOTE]
====
In a real-world scenario you would do the inverse: start with an empty API specification, and define the different elements of the spec document. You would then export the spec in JSON or YAML format (by copying the contents from the source editor) to your local file system and push it to version control.
====


* Launch API Designer by clicking on this link {api_designer_url}[API Designer^, window=api_designer]

== Configure 3scale API Management to secure and manage Mobile Gateway API

The Mobile API has now been designed in the API Designer, and is governed by Red Hat Build of Apicurios Registry. 

Let us fast forward a bit in time, and the backend developers team has built the Mobile Gateway server-side https://github.com/rh-cloud-architecture-workshop/globex-mobile-gateway[code^, window="code-samples"] built using Quarkus. This service has been pre-deployed under the `globex-apim-{user_name}` namespace on OpenShift. 


In this section you will manage and secure the Mobile Gateway API endpoints so that the Mobile App can access them securely. To create these API endpoints, and secure and manage them, we will need to configure them on 3scale API management. 

=== Section Goals 

* setup Red Hat SSO to provide single sign-on (SSO) capabilities for users signing into Mobile App 
* setup Red Hat SSO to secure Mobile Gateway API endpoints using OpenID Connect
* manage Mobile Gateway APIs with Red Hat 3scale API Management
* access Red Hat 3scale API Management's Developer Portal as a Mobile Developer to sign up for access of API

=== Red Hat SSO
3scale integrates with Red Hat SSO for authenticating the API requests using the OpenID Connect specification. On signing-up, External/Mobile developers  will be provided with client credentialsto access to the APIs securely. This client credentials is synced between 3scale and the Red Hat Single Sign-On server using a component know an *Zync*

In order to setup OpenID Connect, you will now create a special *client id* meant for *Client Credentials Management*

* Click to launch {sso_tenant_console}[Red Hat SSO^, window="sso"] and login using username and password `(globex/{user_password})`.
* Click on *Clients* from the left-hand navigation. And, then click on the *Create* button on the right side as shown below

+
.Red Hat SSO: Clients listing
image::client-add.png[]

* In the *Add Client* wizard, enter the following details, and click on the *Save* button.

[width=60%]
|====
| Name | Value

|Client Id | `client-manager`
|Client Protocol (dropdown) | `openid-connect`
|====

.Red Hat SSO: Add Client wizard
image::client-manager.png[]


*  You will be shown the *Settings* tab of `client-manager` client.
+
.Red Hat SSO: View *client-manager* Settings
image::new-client-save.png[]

* Configure this `client-manager` as follows (refer to screenshot below) so that 3scale can synchronize with Red Hat SSO 
** Change *Access Type* to `Confidential`
** Once the Access Types is Confidential you will see a new toggle button *Service Accounts Enabled*
** Keep *Service Accounts Enabled* as ON, and turn all other Grants and Flow OFF to match the following screenshot.
+
This configuration allows only Services based access using Service Accounts, and will be used by 3scale API Management system in the next steps, when mobile users sign up for access. Service accounts provide a flexible way to control API access without sharing a regular user's credentials.
+
.Red Hat SSO: Configure client-manager
image::client-manager-setting.png[]

* Click on *Save* button at the bottom of the page. You will be notified that the changes are saved successfully. +

.Red Hat SSO: Save client-manager settings
image::client-manager-save.png[]

* Now you will need to setup *Client Roles* for this client id, so that it can manage other clients (create, amend and delete) on behalf of 3scale API Management
** Click on the *Service Account Roles* tab from the top tab navigation.
** From the *Client Roles* dropdown, choose `realm-management`
+
.Red Hat SSO: setup Service Account Roles for *client-manager* in Service Account Roles tab
image::sso-service-acc-tab.png[]
* From the *Available Roles* multichoice field, choose `manage-clients`, and click on *Add selected >>* button
** The mappings will get auto-saved.

==== Update Red Hat SSO's Web Origin to match Mobile App
There is one last step that you need to do before trying out the Mobile App. You need to update the *Web Origin*

* Navigate to click on {sso_tenant_console}/#/realms/globex/clients[Red Hat SSO Clients List^,window="sso"]. Login if needed with *(globex/openshift)*.

* Click on the new Client ID that was created when you signed up for Mobile Gateway Application

[TIP]
====
[Click to learn] Where do I find this Client ID?
====

* Close to the bottom of this page, you would see the *Web Origins* field. 
* Update this field with the following value and click on *Save*

=== Section Outcome
* 3scale Backend, Product, ActiveDocs and Users were created
* Developer Portal was setup for public access without Access Code
* Signed for an Application as a Mobile Developer
* Patched Red Hat SSO Web Origin so that the calls from Globex Mobile App will not cause errors

== Test Mobile Application 

In the previous section, you signed up for access as a Mobile Developer and gained credentials to access the Globex Mobile Gateway API. In this section you will complete Mobile App configuration and test this out

[NOTE]
====
As part of this workshop, you will use a mobile-friendly Angular App and not a mobile-native app. So no mobile app installation is necessary. This Mobile App is work in progress and at present shows only categories and products within each category.
====

// The Mobile Application can be access via this QR Code as well as via browser

* Open this https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=qr&chl=https://globex-mobile-globex-apim-{user_name}.{openshift_subdomain}&chs=200x200[QR Code Link^] to view the QR Code and scan using your mobile phone to access the Mobile App

* Alternatively, open this URL in *Incognito Mode* to view https://globex-mobile-globex-apim-{user_name}.{openshift_subdomain}[Globex Mobile^]. This is to ensure that there is no clash with previous logins to RH-SSO.
* Click on Login, and login using `(asilva/openshift)`
* The login process may take a few seconds. Please wait for bit :)
+
.User is logged in
image::apim-mobile-loggedin.png[width=40%]
* After logging in, click on the *View the categories* button. You will view on a list of Categories available
+
.Categories view
image::mobile-categories.png[width=40%]
* Click on the 'Clothing' category to view the Product Listing.
* Try out a few more categories too which will help us to generate some traffic to view in the Analytics section.


=== Analytics
* Navigate to the {globex_developer_portal}/buyer/stats[Globex Developer Portal Statistics^, window="devportal"] 
* From the dropdown indicated in this screenshot, choose the Mobile Gateway API's application plan (which is  `basic-plan` in this case).
* You will be presented with the statistics graph of the calls made to this gateway by the Partner Developer's access.

=== Under the hood
As part of this Section you tried out the Mobile App. 



* The user *asilva* you logged into the Mobile App as, is authenticated using Red Hat SSO.
* Once the user logs in, a token is generated by Red Hat SSO using the Client ID, SSO Authority details that you passed to the Mobile App to setup the configuration
* This token is authenticated by 3scale to ensure the Client ID indeed has access to that particular API
* The token is also passed onto the backend service running on OpenShift, which checks for validity of the token. 
* The https://github.com/rh-cloud-architecture-workshop/globex-mobile-gateway/blob/main/src/main/java/org/globex/gateway/mobile/rest/MobileCatalogResource.java[REST endpoints^, window="code-samples"] is supplied with the SSO URL information as part of the https://github.com/rh-cloud-architecture-workshop/globex-mobile-gateway/blob/main/src/main/resources/application.properties[application.properties, window="code-samples"]
* The endpoints are protected with @Authenticated which in this case looks for a valid token being present.
+
.REST endpoint is annotated with @Authenticated

With that we wrap up the activities *Design, Govern, Manage, Secure* Globex Mobile Gateway APIs for access from the Mobile Application securely.


== Congratulations
With this you have completed the *Contract First API Advanced* workshop!
