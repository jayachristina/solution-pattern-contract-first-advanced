== Setup Partner Gateway and Partner Web App (Optional)

Before we start this section, close all the browser tabs except for this browser tab. This will help you navigate this section more easily.

Since we've gone through the Design and Governance sections of the Mobile API, in this section we will skip the design section. We'll also keep discussions to only essentials :)

=== Publish Partner API to Service Registry

* If you don't have a browser tab open with OpenShift Dev Spaces, click on {devspaces_dashboard}/dashboard/#/ide/devspaces-{user_name}/cloud-architecture-workshop[Dev Spaces IDE^, window="devspaces"]. If needed login with your username and password ({user_name}/{user_password}).
* In Dev Spaces, navigate to the folder `module-apim -> partner -> activedoc`, and open the file `partner-activedoc-draft.json`. 
** Or type [Ctrl+P] and type the file name as `partner-activedoc-draft.json`
* Scroll to the bottom of the page where you can see the *securitySchemes* section
+
.Partner OpenAPI Security Schemes section

=== Create Backend, Products, ActiveDoc and Users for Partner Gateway

==== Create Backend
* In Dev Spaces , under the folder `module-apim -> partners -> gateway`, open the file `partner-gateway-backend.yaml`
* Substitute *"<replace-me>"* with the Service endpoint of the Globex Partner gateway service appended with the port as `:8080`. This URL is given below 
+
[source,bash,role=copy,subs="attributes"]
----
http://globex-partner-gateway.globex-apim-{user_name}.svc.cluster.local:8080
----
* After substitution the *partner-gateway-backend.yaml* file should looks like 
+
.partner-gateway-backend file
image::partner-gateway-backend.png[width=80%]
* Run the following command which will create a Partner Gateway Backend in 3scale.
+
[source,bash,role=copy, subs="attributes"]
----
oc apply -f /projects/workshop-devspaces/workshop/module-apim/partners/gateway/partner-gateway-backend.yaml -n globex-apim-{user_name}
----
.Output
----
backend.capabilities.3scale.net/globex-partner-gateway-backend created
----

==== Create Products
* In Dev Spaces , under the folder `module-apim -> partners -> gateway`, open the file `partner-gateway-product.yaml`

+
.partner-gateway-product.yaml file
image::partner-gateway-product.png[width=80%]

* Get the value for *<client-credentials>* placeholder as described below. Or if you have copied this into Scratchpad you can use that instead.
** Open the {sso_tenant_console}/#/realms/globex/clients[SSO Clients List^, window="sso"] from Red Hat SSO.
** Login if needed with *({user_name}/{user_password})*.

=== Setup Partner Web Portal
* In the previous section, you signed up for access as a Partner Developer and gained credentials to access the APIs Globex exposes.
* To update the Partner Web application you need these values
** *Client ID & Client Secret* - Needs to be fetched from Red Hat SSO
** *Token URL* - From Red Hat SSO - But available here in the instructions
** *Globex API Endpoint* - From Red Hat 3scale - But available here in the instructions
* These values are part of {openshift_cluster_console}/k8s/ns/globex-apim-{user_name}/deployments/globex-partner-web/environment[globex-partner-web deployment, window="console"] and are highlighted in the screenshot below
+
.globex-partner-web Deployment
image::partner-web-deployment-env.png[]


* The *Client ID* and *Client Secret* with values as placeholders are predeployed as a Kubernetes Secret called *secret.yaml*.
** In the Dev workspace, under the folder `/projects/workshop-devspaces/workshop/module-apim/partners/partner-web`  open the file *secret.yaml*
+
.secret.yaml
image::partner_secret_yaml.png[width=60%]


** Update the *Client ID* and *Client Secret* from the previous step on 3scale Developer Portal
+
.Client ID and Client Secret from 3scale Developer Portal
image::apim-devportal-partner-clientid.png[width=70%]

* Update *Token URL* with the following value
+
[source,bash,role=copy,subs="attributes"]
----
https://sso.{openshift_subdomain}/auth/realms/globex/protocol/openid-connect/token
----

* In the *Dev Spaces Terminal* apply changes made to the *secret.yaml* by running the following command
+
[source,bash,role=copy,subs="attributes"]
----
oc apply -f /projects/workshop-devspaces/workshop/module-apim/partners/partner-web/secret.yaml -n globex-apim-{user_name}
----
+
.Output
----
secret/globex-partner-web configured
----
* The final step is to patch the Partner Web portal with the *Partner Gateway API endpoint*. 
** You would ideally get this from 3scale. But since you have learnt how to do this with Mobile API, we will skip navigating to 3scale to save some time.
** Execute this script in the Dev Spaces Terminal
+
[source,bash,role=copy,subs="attributes"]
----
oc set env deployments/globex-partner-web --overwrite GLOBEX_PARTNER_GATEWAY=https://globex-partner-gateway-product-3scale-{user_name}-apicast-production.{openshift_subdomain}
----
+
[source,subs="attributes"]
.Output 
----
deployment.apps/globex-partner-web updated

== Test Partner Web Application 

In the previous section, you signed up for access as a Partner Developer and gained credentials to access the Globex PArtner Gateway API. You also setup the necessary configurations for the Partner Web Application.


* Launch the https://globex-partner-web-globex-apim-{user_name}.{openshift_subdomain}[Globex Partner Web^]
+
.Partner Web Portal
image::partner_web_portal.png[]
* Login using username/password as *(partner/openshift)*. 
** It is notable that the partner users are not managed using Red Hat SSO. 
* After logging in, the entire product list is shown in a paginated format.
** Allow a few seconds for the catalogue to load
* Reload this page by hitting the Browser Refresh a few times which will help us to generate some analytics.
+
.User logged in and can view paginated products
image::apim-partner-loggedin.png[width=80%]


=== Analytics
* Navigate to the {globex_developer_portal}/buyer/stats[Globex Developer Portal Statistics^, window="devportal"] 
* From the dropdown indicated in this screenshot, choose the Partner Gateway API's application plan (which is  `partner-basic` in this case).
* You will be presented with the statistics graph of the calls made to this gateway by the Partner Developer's access.
+
image::apim-partner-analytics.png[]

=== Under the hood
As part of this Section you setup and tested the Partner Web App. 

* The user *partner* that you logged into the Partner App as, is not authenticated using Red Hat SSO. In fact it is not authenticated at all. 
** This is because the way partners handle user authentication is not something that Globex is concerned about at all.
* In this scenario we use Client Credentials authentication, because the backend NodeJS server authenticates itself with Client ID and Credentials obtained by the Partner Developer while signing up for an Application via 3scale Developer Portal
* The token generated by NodeJS is then exchanged with 3scale to ensure the Client ID indeed has access to that particular API
